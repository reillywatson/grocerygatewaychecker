grocerygatewaychecker scrapes the grocerygateway.com website and sends me an SMS because not only am I too lazy to go to the grocery store, I'm also too lazy to constantly reload this website and scroll through a list of time slots. You'd need a Twilio account for the SMS parts to work, and also if you live near me and use this it makes me less likely to snipe these delivery slots, so you probably don't want to use this!
